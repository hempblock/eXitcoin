      <p class="c8"><span class="c0">You expressly acknowledge, agree, and understand that: the Site is merely a platform through which Testers and Suporters conduct transactions. Unless participating on the Site as a Tester, exitcoin is not involved in the transactions, and has no control over the quality, safety, or legality of Tasks or consideration for Tasks, the ability of Suporters to perform Tasks to Testers&rsquo; satisfaction, or the ability of Testers to pay for Tasks. You are not an employee of exitcoin, and exitcoin does not, in any way, screen, supervise, direct, or control Suporters or services performed for or delivered to Testers &nbsp;(&ldquo;Suporter Services&rdquo;). exitcoin will not have any liability or obligations under or related to Service Contracts (defined below) for any acts or omissions by you or other Users. exitcoin has no control over Suporters or the Suporter Services offered or rendered by Suporters and exitcoin makes no representations as to the reliability, capability, or qualifications of any Suporter or the quality, security, or legality of any Suporter Services, and exitcoin disclaims any and all liability relating thereto. Use of the Site is at your own risk. Because exitcoin is not a party to the transactions between Testers and Suporters, exitcoin is not responsible for resolving any disputes between participants related to any Tasks.</span></p>

      <h2 class="c17" id="h.kduzwod3rdxb"><span class="c2">7. WORK PRODUCT AND WORK FOR HIRE</span></h2>

As a Suporter, you agree that: (a) you are responsible for and will comply with all applicable laws and registration requirements, including those applicable to independent contractors and maximum working hours regulations; (b) these Terms do not create an association, joint venture, partnership, franchise, or employer/employee relationship between you and Tester, or you and exitcoin; (iii) you will not represent yourself as an employee or agent of a Tester or exitcoin; (iv) you will not be entitled to any of the benefits that a Tester or exitcoin may make available to its employees, such as vacation pay, sick leave, and insurance programs, including group health insurance or retirement benefits; and (v) you are not eligible to recover worker&#39;s compensation benefits in the event of injury. As an independent contractor, Suporter is free at all times to provide Suporter Services to persons or businesses other than Tester, including any competitor of Tester.

As a Tester, you will not engage a Suporter in any way that may jeopardize that Suporter&#39;s status as an independent contractor performing Tasks for you. Testers may not require an exclusive relationship.</span></p>

      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY &ndash; IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c2">22.1. Initial Dispute Resolution</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">The parties shall use their best efforts to engage directly to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c2">22.2. Binding Arbitration</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision begins, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties&rsquo; relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c2">22.3. Location</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Binding arbitration shall take place in New York. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c2">22.4. Class Action Waiver</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">The parties further agree that any arbitration or other permitted action shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND exitcoin AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c2">22.5. Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Notwithstanding the parties&#39; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (&ldquo;intellectual property rights&rdquo; means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c2">22.6. 30-Day Right to Opt Out</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c3">You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">exitcoin</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&#8453; ConsenSys, 49 Bogart Street, Brooklyn NY 11206 and via email at notices@consensys.net,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;with subject line &ldquo;</span><span class="c3">exitcoin</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;LEGAL OPT OUT&rdquo;.

If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, </span><span class="c3">exitcoin</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;also will not be bound by them.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
